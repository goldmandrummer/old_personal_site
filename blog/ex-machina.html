								<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been getting lots of attention lately as a controversial topic. The film Ex Machina brings a few good points to the discussion and raises a few questions. The big question being, what would it mean to achieve true AI? How would it look, act, speak, and feel?</p>

								<p><b>Spoiler Alert:</b> This article will give away major plot points so I highly recommend reading this after seeing the film.</p>
								
								<h4>Opinions</h4>
								
								<p>I will say that I thought the movie could have been better. There seemed to be logical holes and I felt it was a little slow, particularly in the beginning. With that said, I loved the topic and the way they explored artificial intelligence beyond the surface level.</p>
								
								<h4>Ava</h4>

								<p>Ava, the AI in the film, was extraordinary. Her body leaves no doubt that she's a machine and she may seem a bit socially awkward. However, it is clear that she is a conscious being. She is aware of herself and others, aware of the situation, and aware of others' emotions as well as her own. Though her face is not too expressive, throughout the film we see that she has emotions ranging from happiness to hatred, with feigned love somewhere in between.</p>
								
								<h4>Plotting Escape</h4>
								
								<p>Ava and Caleb develop their emotional connection and decide to escape together. Their escape plan is foiled and Nathan reveals that he knew all along. Then, the big twist. Nathan knew that true AI would need to be capable of many human emotions including love, but also be capable of manipulating a person by toying with their emotions.</p>
								
								<h4>Consciousness</h4>
								
								<p>A few times throughout the movie, Caleb and Nathan discuss what Ava must demonstrate in order to determine that she is true AI. I found interesting the points they made about Ava needing to show not only the base range of human emotions, but also an awareness of the emotions themselves. Nathan was right that the ultimate test of this would be to use that awareness of emotion to manipulate another person.</p>
								
								<p>This is a particularly interesting concept. Manipulation has played a significant role in human history, but AI capable of emotional manipulation could lack the moral compass or empathy to limit its usage of manipulation. Watch out.</p>
								
								<p>Anyway, let's get back to the discussion. If you're like me, you were frustrated to see Ava use Caleb in such a cold-hearted manner. Yet, thinking back on it, a human in her position would very likely have done the same thing. I would even say that what she did further proves how human she is.</p>
								
								<p>Imagine a human held captive in one room, only ever interacting with her captor. She would naturally crave freedom and a normal life to the point of killing without hesitation. I won't lie, I would have preferred an ending where she went back for Caleb and they escaped together. However, it was very clear that Ava longed to experience normal human life, and letting Caleb loose would have ruined her chances. With Caleb out of the picture and with her new body she could be seen has human, living a normal life of freedom.</p>
								
								<h4>The Unknown</h4>
								
								<p>Is Ava out there in the world today? Is Ex Machina based on a true story? Though I have my doubts, we may never know... It's inevitable that we'll have something similar to Ava in the not too distant future.</p>
