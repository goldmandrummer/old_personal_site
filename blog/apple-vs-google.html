								<p>Recently, Apple hosted its WWDC 2014 and people have been talking about the jabs made towards Google. After reading some articles discussing the topic, I would like to share my view.</p>

								<p>In my opinion, Google focuses on functionality and keeping things open to allow personalization. I feel as though Apple is more focused on polished design which then takes away personalization because the company makes some decisions for you.</p>

								<p>Both of these things are very good and honestly they work really well for catering to the needs and desires of the large majority of the market. I feel as though many people who choose iPhones (and don't jailbreak) really don't want to mess with a lot of settings and customizations but would rather purchase something that is a fully polished product they can rely on. On the other hand, people choose Android because they want to get a device that they can make their own.</p>

								<p>I should make a side note to point out that Apple was not only discussing iOS competing against Android, but also discussed Safari as a replacement to Chrome and the Spotlight search as a replacement to a Google search.</p>

								<p>I feel as though Apple's new features announced at WWDC 2014 are inspired by features from Android and Google services. I think that they found some key things that people like about Google products but which didn't exist on Apple products and then they created a simplified, streamlined version of the features with the classic Apple style added. They would state that you could accomplish the same thing via Google, but that Apple provided an alternative which you might find simpler or more seamless.</p>

								<p>I think this is great for users, especially those who stick with Apple. I also think it's good for the market because there are less features that one side misses out on. However, I feel as though Apple tries to convert consumers from using Google products whereas it seems to me that Google doesn't try to convert Apple users.</p>

								<p>Is this an all out war? I don't feel as though it is or that it should be. I think that if Apple's goal is to take over the entire market and kill off Google, then they should stop trying. I can't imagine Google is going to die off and I don't think that the population of Android users will diminish much, if at all. I am all for the companies putting their products out there and letting the people choose what they like rather than trying to pull people to one side or the other.</p>

								<p>Wherever you stand on this topic, enjoy the technology you have available to you and do your best to move it forward. Thanks for reading this post and I hope you enjoyed it!</p>
