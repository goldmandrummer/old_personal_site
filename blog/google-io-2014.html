								<p>I think there were two main points of this year's I/O. The first of which being that they will be expanding the Android platform into wearables (i.e. smart watches), vehicles, and TV's. The idea is that every smart device you own can be seamlessly connected and in sync through the Android platform. While this may be new for Google, I think that this is something that the company has learned from Apple's success.</p>

								<p>Two things that made people fall in love with Apple products and had them buying up every iThing they could is that they knew what they were getting and they knew it would work wonderfully with their other devices. Apple devices were set up to sync up seamlessly and Apple kept design under control so that users could have a familiar interface across their devices and apps. This was brilliant and I believe it was vital to their success. So as I see Google starting to follow that sort of philosophy, I can't help but think it's pretty awesome that Apple learned from Google and announced some changes at WWDC 2014 and Google learned from Apple and announced those changes shortly after at I/O 14.</p>

								<p>I think most of the talk about Android Wear was sort of old news. The thing I hadn't known was that clearing notifications on the watch would also clear it from the phone. I hadn't given it much thought, but I see that it would otherwise be very annoying to see every notification twice.</p>

								<p>I hadn't heard anything about Android TV or Android Auto and I am excited for both to hit the market. People are saying that Android TV is very similar to what Amazon has put out and that there didn't seem to be much new here. I think what is new is that Google is claiming it's spot in this space, ensuring smooth connection to the phone, and emphasizing their TV platform as a better way to experience your favorite games from the Play store.</p>

								<p>As for the auto world, I find this to be a very smart move for Google and I love the idea of it. In today's smarter cars, you can sync your phone and use your car sound system for your phone. To my understanding, that has been the extent of it. Google is changing that. I absolutely loved the way they pointed out how much of a negative impact texting while driving has had on our world, then they acknowledged the fact that people want to be connected to the outside world even while driving, and finally they presented a safer solution to the problem. They take advantage of the voice controls they do so well, and allow you to keep your hands on the wheel while staying connected. I think these three platforms are great extensions of the Android world and will turn out to be a success for Google. If anyone else is like me, they want to buy up these devices and start experiencing the full potential of the Android system we love.</p>

								<p>With all the new devices to run on Android, it would all get overwhelming if the design of the apps and operating system were different. I would say the second main point of I/O was that Google is taking more control over Android in order to ensure a consistent experience across all these devices. A major way in which they're doing this is clearly communicating new design standards for application and web design so that users can quickly and easily move from one app to another, to the web, and back with all of it feeling familiar. Google is making it easy by ensuring each platform will match that of the phone. Consistent design and controls across the board will make it all easy to pick up. To do this, the company has created a set of design standards developers can follow. These design standards are based around something Google calls Material Design. Check out the short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8TXgCzxEnw" target="_blank">video demo</a> to better understand what I'm talking about.</p>

								<p>Material Design is essentially Google's vision for modern, clean designs that clearly and simply convey information to the viewer all while being very responsive. A large part of Material Design is the concept of cards. As you can see in the video clip I mentioned above, the cards can be given different levels of shadow behind them to have them appear to be floating above the background. Because I am very interested in user experience/interface design, I thought this was especially cool after hearing some explanation from presenters at Google.</p>

								<p>Presenters repeatedly discussed how Material Design, and specifically the Paper elements, are not only for visual appeal but also to add implied meaning to the things on the screen. To explain a bit further, if something is outlined in a box on the screen but is not given any shadow, it would appear that this is a part of the page and it will stay part of the page as you scroll and will not move in relation to the page as a whole. However, when you add shadow and depth to the cards, they appear to float above the page itself and thus it can be naturally implied that the card is a separate object which can be scrolled over the background, slid around the screen, or swept aside to be removed. The other thing that this depth can convey is importance in the sense that something appearing closer and more raised from the screen may be more important.</p>

								<p>I encourage all of you to look at demos and explanations of Material Design and the Paper objects. Also, find out more about Android Wear, TV and Auto. What do you think about the direction Google is going?</p>
